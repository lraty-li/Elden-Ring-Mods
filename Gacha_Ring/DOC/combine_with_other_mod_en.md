[DarkScript](https://github.com/AinTunez/DarkScript3/releases)

## emevd

### Check whether event ids conflict

id 9970, 9971, 9972, 9973 are used. If the mod you want to merge already uses some of them, you need to ctrl f to find and change them all to any other number. The same goes for the other step

### Adds the initialization for the new event

emved is responsible for handling various events in the game, each of which is similar Structure of

``` javascript
$Event(event id, Default, function() {
...
code
...
});
```

open common.emevd.dcx using DarkScript, add the contents of emevd_0.txt to common.emevd.dcx's ```$Event(0,),``` noting that added to the function in the argument, After adding it, it will look like this:

<https://github.com/lraty-li/Elden-Ring-Mods/blob/main/Gacha_Ring/emved/common.emevd.dcx.js#L372>

``` javascript
$Event(event id, Default, function() {
...
InitializeEvent(0, 9970, 0);
InitializeEvent(0, 9971, 0);
InitializeEvent(0, 9973, 0);
...
});
```

### Added mod new events

Add the contents of emevd_1.txt to common.emevd.dcx, which you can scroll to the bottom of the document with DarkScript, and then paste directly. These are independent new events, dont added to other events as in the previous step.

### Save

ctrl + s in DarkScript

## esd

### Get t000001000.py

Drag script/talk/m00_00_00_00.talkesdbnd.dcx to Yabber.exe, you should get folder m00_00_00_00_-Talkesdbnd-dcx, go into folder, Drag t000001000.esd to esdtool.exe, enter the configuration as prompted, and it will be decompiled to t000001000.py

### grace menu options

You need to add the contents of t000001000.py_0.txt to ```def t000001000_x31():``` before ```AddTalkListData(99, 20000009, -1)```. **Note that Python uses indentation to distinguish code blocks**. You can add this by making the two lines align. ```AddTalkListData(99, 20000009, -1)``` is the "away" button of the game itself, hopefully other mods haven't modified it

This file contains code from previous mods, so don't worry about the commented out parts
<https://github.com/lraty-li/Elden-Ring-Mods/blob/main/Gacha_Ring/t000001000.py#L1098>

```python
        AddTalkListData(24, 30000000, -1)
        AddTalkListData(99, 20000009, -1)
```

### Raffle menu

Also in the rage of  ```def t000001000_x31():```, add the contents of t000001000.py_1.txt before  ```elif GetTalkListEntryResult() == 2```

<https://github.com/lraty-li/Elden-Ring-Mods/blob/main/Gacha_Ring/t000001000.py#L1135>

``` python
        # gacha ring
        elif GetTalkListEntryResult() == 24:
            c1_140(0)
            c1_110()

            def ExitPause():
                c1_110()
            assert t000001000_x2233()
            pass
            
        # ============================
        elif GetTalkListEntryResult() == 2:
          # upgrade
```

### Item/Soul check, item drop

add the contents of t000001000.py_2.txt directly to common.emevd.dcx, you scroll to the bottom of t000001000.py and paste it directly.

## regulation.bin

### Add tutorialParam

This is not necessary, just to display the picture

- search tutorialParam in Yapped-Rune-Bear and set the parameters of row 1 to:

``` csv
disableParam network test;   Do not check;
menuType;   100;
triggerType;   0;
repeatType;   1;
imageId;   300;
unlockEventFlagId;   1062265997;
textId;   12000;
displayMinTime;   1;
displayTime;   3;
```

- After editing, click on any other row and ctrl s to save

## Add itemLotParam_map

- open regulation.bin with Yapped-Rune-Bear, Export csv through Field - Export Data after itemLotParam_map has been selected with .
- Then go to the Yapped-Rune-Bear.exe folder, Projects\ExampleMod\CSV\ER find TutorialParam.csv, open it, copy and paste the contents of TutorialParam.txt to the end of the file.
- After itemLotParam_map has been selected in Yapped-Rune-Bear, import csv through Field-Import Data and save by ctrl s

## msg
